# Benchmarking tools for detecting longitudinal differential expression in proteomics data allows establishing a robust reproducibility optimization regression approach

## Codes with a running example for the longitudinal differential expression methods used in the manuscript

The selection of a suitable computational tool for the detection of longitudinal differential expression in complex and noisy proteomics data is not a trivial task and no effective, simple-to-use differential expression method for longitudinal proteomics data has yet been released. 

In the manuscript, we have comprehensively evaluated the performance of 16 approaches, including a new method RolDE, for detecting differential expression between two conditions in longitudinal proteomics data. 

In this GitHub repository, you can find the custom codes related to the evaluated longitudinal differential expression methods with a running example.
